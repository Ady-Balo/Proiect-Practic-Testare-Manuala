### Entry criteria:
  - Business specifications are defined 
  - Roles needed for the project are allocated 
  - Initial project risks were detected and mitigated 

### Exit criteria:
  - All test cases have been executed 
  - The unresolved bugs/defects have low priority 
  -  No detected major risks remained un-mitigated 
  -  All resolved bugs have been retested and approved by the testers
  -  Regression testing have been ran and no major bugs detected  
  -  All business requirements have been covered by test cases 
  -  All business requirements have been met 
    
### Risks:
  -  Project risks: lack of experience of QA team, lack of tools, short deadline for Jira and Zephyr Squad, unavailability of OrangeHRM demo environment
  -  Product risks: Validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end user 
  

2.2 **Test analysis** 

Analyze the business requirements to make sure that we have all the details to create the test conditions 
Write test conditions that will be tested in out test process 

2.3 **Test design**

Functional test cases will be created in Jira 
GUI test cases will be created in Jira 
API test case will be created in Postman 
Queries in DB will be done in MySQL

2.4 **Test implementation**

Verify if the following elements are ready before test execution:
  - Test environment is up and running: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login 
  - Access to test environment is given: username Admin, password: admin 123
  - Test cases were added to the cycle summary 
  - Postman collection with the API methods was created 
  - Authorization token was created accessing the API and it is valid 

2.5 **Test execution**

  - Test cases are executed on the created cycle summary 
  - Bugs have been created based on the failed test cases. The complete bug reports can be found here: *se poate pune link catre un fisier cu bug reports in Github 
  - API tests are executed based on the checklist (requirements)
  - Full regression pack is executed after changes made to the application

2.6 **Test closure**

 - All exit criteria were met as mentioned in the Test Planning section (2.1)
 - The traceability matrix was generated to demonstrate the business requirements coverage
 - Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows a number of 3 failed test cases of a total 30
 - There are still 3 opened defects but they have low priority

2.7 **Test monitoring and control**

Various periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken.

3. ## Test deliverables

  3.1 **Test plan**
  
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the type of testing to be performed, the roles and responsibilities for the testing process, the resources and schedule required to complete testing and the risks associated with the plan. 

  3.2 **Test conditions**
  
*The following test conditions were created:
